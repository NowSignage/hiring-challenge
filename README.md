NowSignage Programming Challenge
================================

Introduction
------------

Thanks for applying to NowSignage! We're always looking to grow our backend Platform team.

To gauge your experience with Rails and associated technologies, we ask our candidates to look through a small repository and figure out any refactorings and improvements to the code that the candidate can provide.

NowSignage acquired  a company that allowed users to upload backgrounds and categorize them.

Unfortunately, due diligence wasn't taken into account when NowSignage bought Absolute Bodge Software Ltd, and we find ourselves in possession of their particularly poor codebase.

The code assumes that all resources are publicly available, we're not going to hook into any user authentication for this project. Any comments prefixed with `[TEST-GUIDANCE]` are notes from NowSignage to the candidate, not a part of the project.

We need you, our newest developer to look through the code and get it up to standard.

The Task
--------

1.  Please fork the following repository: <https://github.com/NowSignage/hiring-challenge>

2.  Inspect the code, and attempt to refactor the code in order to make it more maintainable.

3.  Check out any TODOs, can you implement these long-missed features to make the code more valuable?

4.  The code looks like it _probably_ works, and at NowSignage, we need code we _know_ works. Can you add tests to make sure it'll continue to work in future?

5.  Once you're done, either shoot over an email to <m.ryder@nowsignage.com> or open an PR/Issue on your forked repo and ping @MattRyder.
